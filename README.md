# 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

### This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. You can find final screens [here](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/623/Archive.zip)
